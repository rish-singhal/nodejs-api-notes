# API Design and NodeJS

## What is an API?

API is an interface that allows you to access data from a server or interact with some abstracted system.

## Terminologies

**CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete
**REST**: Representational State Transfer; a desing pattern for APIs

Route paths, HTTP verbs, and Database resources are the three main components of an API.

## Where does NodeJS comes in?

- **Single Threaded:** Not good for CPU intensive tasks
- **Concurrent**
- **Asynchronous**
- **Even Driven**

Have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (Node Package Manager) which have a good community contributing many packages to the NodeJs ecosystem. For example ExpressJS.

## MongoDB

Non-relational document store, storing JSON like a blob.

~ Have tons of hosting solutions. For example Atlas

**ORM/ ODM:** Object Relational Mapper (ORM) converting data types in and out.
